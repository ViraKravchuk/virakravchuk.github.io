                        <p id="reading"> For pleasure, knowledge, experience, emotions. </p>
						<p id="reading">I have loved books since childhood. Dad used to take me to the bookstore every weekend, where I wandered among the tall shelves with stories in colored covers. I have always seen reading as a hobby. Now it's also a habit that I follow every day. I hope I will manage to connect my future career with the book industry.</p>
					    <p id="reading"> I won't say that I'm a bookworm but I really like books. I love their smell, their benefits, different worlds and characters, melodious combinations of words, and fascinating unpredictable plots. And the point is not in the number of books I read in a month or a year just to tick or brag on Instagram. It's about a real pleasure from the process, absorption into another world, lessons learned, an aftertaste, and reflection on what I read. I hate skimming books. The best reading happens when you notice small details, references, connections and reread the masterfully chosen words. </p>
					    <p id="reading">I read good books and bad books, sophisticated and simple, long and short. I want to have a taste of various genres, styles, and topics. Although you can find non-fiction on my shelf, my soul asks the fiction more often.</p>
